# Personal Finance Tracker

A Personal Finance Tracker built using Tkinter to help users keep track of their daily expenses. This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for recording expenses along with their categories and dates. 

## Features

- Expense Logging: Add expense amounts, categories, and dates easily in the interface.
- Validation: Ensures all fields are filled before adding an expense.
- Dynamic Feedback: Displays success or error messages directly within the app. 
- File Saving: Expenses are saved in a CSV file, which allows for data retention even after closing the app.
- Total Expense Calcultion: Calculates and displays the total expense at the bottom of the window and CSV file, updated every time a new expense is added.
